		<h3 id="is_google_summer_of_code_gsoc_a_recruiting_program">Is Google Summer of Code (GSoC) a recruiting program?</h3>
		<p>No. If you are interested in working for Google, please visit the
		<a href="http://www.google.com/about/careers/">Google jobs website.</a></p>
		<h3 id="is_gsoc_considered_an_internship_a_job_or_any_form_of_employment">Is GSoC considered an internship, a job, or any form of employment?</h3>
		<p>No. GSoC is an activity that the student performs as an independent developer
		for which he/she is paid a stipend.</p>
		<h3 id="are_mentoring_organizations_required_to_use_the_code_produced_by_students">Are mentoring organizations required to use the code produced by students?</h3>
		<p>No. While we hope that all the code that comes out of this program will find a
		happy home, we don’t require organizations to use the student's' code.</p>
		<h3 id="where_does_gsoc_occur">Where does GSoC occur?</h3>
		<p>Google Summer of Code occurs entirely online; there is no requirement to travel
		as part of the program.</p>
		<h3 id="what_can_i_do_to_help_spread_the_word_about_gsoc">What can I do to help spread the word about GSoC?</h3>
		<p>You can download
		<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/media">flyers</a> to post
		around your campus. You can also tweet about the program, make YouTube videos,
		or host a meetup or information session in your area.</p>
		<h3 id="how_do_i_organize_or_host_a_gsoc_information_session_or_meetup">How do I organize or host a GSoC information session or meetup?</h3>
		<p>You are welcome to schedule a meetup at whatever time and place is convenient
		for you! Please review the
		<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/rules">GSoC Program Rules</a> first
		and utilize our
		<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/presentations">presentation template</a>
		and flyers. Send us the details of the meetup (date, location, time etc.) and we
		will add it to our external calendar.</p>
		<p>We'd love to see a blog post (including pictures!) for the
		<a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/">Google Open Source Blog</a> after the
		event happens so we can showcase your efforts.</p>
		<h3 id="can_i_participate_in_gsoc_as_both_a_mentor_and_a_student">Can I participate in GSoC as both a mentor and a student?</h3>
		<p>No. We want to make sure that each project and student receives sufficient
		attention, and we feel this could create a bad experience for those
		involved. Please choose whether participation as a mentor or a student is more
		appealing to you and plan to apply accordingly.</p>
		<h3 id="what_if_i_have_a_question_not_answered_in_this_faq">What if I have a question not answered in this FAQ?</h3>
		<p>Please make sure to read the
		<a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCStudentGuide/">Student Manual</a>. If after reading
		through all the documentation you still don't have an answer please consider
		reaching out to the GSoC community via IRC or the discussion list. Visit the
		<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/contact">Contact Us</a> page for
		more detailed information.</p>

		<p>Please talk to your school's international student affairs office for more
		details. In the past, students on an F1 visa have participated in GSoC through
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curricular_Practical_Training">CPT</a>, but you will
		need to check with your school to see what will work best.</p>
		<p>Students with accepted projects can receive a CPT letter upon request.</p>
		<h3 id="accredited">How do I know if my school is “accredited”?</h3>
		<p>You can learn more about accreditation for universities
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_accreditation">here.</a> Please note
		that participating in online courses, even if they are with accredited
		universities, does not alone constitute enrollment. You must be/will be enrolled
		at the university.</p>

		<p>For the most complete information on student proposals, please consult the
		<a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCStudentGuide/">Student Manual</a>. The best
		proposals are from students who took the time to interact and discuss their
		ideas with the organization <strong>before</strong> submission.</p>
		<p>Great proposals include the following: your project proposal, why you'd like to
		execute on this particular project, and the reason you're the best individual to
		do so. It should also include details of your academic, industry, and/or open
		source development experience. An explanation of your development methodology is
		always a good idea.</p>
